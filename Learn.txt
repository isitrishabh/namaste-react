React Components
-------------------

There are 2 types of react components:

1. Function Based Components
2. Class Based Components

Note: Always name a component starting with Capital letter

1. Function Based Components:  
------------------------------
> It is just a JS function which returns a JSX element.

Note: JSX element is nothing but a React Element after transpiling by Babel.
React Element in itself is a Object.

e.g.

const HeadingComponent=()=>{
    return <h1> Namaste react from functional component </h1>;
}

Calling Other functional component from another component
1. <ComponentName/>
2. {ComponentName()}

For JSX Element
1. {JSX Element}

Thus, within {} we can execute JS inside JSX.

Passing props to a component
-------------------------------
It is simply passing arguments to the functional component
It is wrapped as a object and then passed 

Congig driven UI: UI is rendered on the basis of data

Export
------
1. Default Export/Default Import
2. Individual Export/{} Import


React Hooks(state)
------------
These are just normal JS functions created by react developers.

2 types of Hooks.
1. useState
2. useEffects

State variable is defined inside a component.
Whenever a state variable changes, react re-renders the component.
